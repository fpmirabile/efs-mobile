## Installation

### Important
You will need to use [Node12](https://nodejs.org/es/download/) or greater
You will need to install [watchmen](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) in case you are on a MacOS.

1. Do a `npm install` before everything
2. Run `npm start` and you should see the expo page in your default browser
    a. Be careful, if you see the next message:
    ```This command requires Expo CLI. Do you want to install it globally [Y/n]?```
    That means that you will need to install globally expo cli. Just write Y and press enter and npm should handle the installation.
3. To run inside your device: 
    You will need to download `Expo` app from your app store (or play store).
    Then scan the QR code in the expo browser page, and that's it all!
